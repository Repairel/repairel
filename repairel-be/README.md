Project duration: 21st September to 15th October 2020.

- Design week: ideation to prototyping.
- Two 6-day build sprints:
  - First focused on building the database and skeleton of the platform.
  - Second focused on the intricate functionalities - filter and compare - and overall styling.

## Future development

- Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx and attatch an SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt
- Set up a webhook from Github to update the deployed version on push/
- Stock control in general needs to be implemented - given sufficient funds a switch to shopify could be good.
